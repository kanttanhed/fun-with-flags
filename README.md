# Fun with flags

An interactive web application focused on front-end development. The main goal is to create an application that showcases all countries and their characteristics, offering a rich and informative experience through a modern and interactive interface.

I will use an API to fetch accurate and up-to-date information about the countries. The data will be retrieved dynamically, ensuring updated content.

Each country will be represented with:

Flag
Capital
Population
Official language(s)
Currency
Borders
Other relevant geographical and cultural characteristics
The project will leverage:

ReactJS and NextJS for building the application
Tailwind CSS for styling
APIs for fetching country data
Responsive design to ensure usability across all devices
